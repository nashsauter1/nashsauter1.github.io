# Welcome to my blog!
Hello everyone! I decided to start up this blog as a small side project. I'm not sure how often I'll be using it, but if I want to write anything that requires some effort it'll probably go here.
I sloppily bootstrapped together this blog using Github Pages and Jekyll, so let me know if there's anything that doesn't look right.
In terms of what I hope to write about here, it'll most likely be related to politics or philosophy, but could also delve into other topics seeing as this isn't meant to be anything serious.
I hope you all enjoy!
