## Setting the Stage for Negative Utilitarianism

{% quote popper2002 %}
Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all.

### A Runaway Train
Take a second to imagine a runaway train going down a line of railroad tracks.
Ahead of this train, a mysterious villain has tied down a set of five strangers to the tracks such that they'll all be run over and painfully killed if the train continues on its current course.
You, the natural hero of the story, decide that you want to look for a way to prevent these five people from being killed.
Right in front of you, you notice a lever with labels that lead you to believe you can switch the trains course to another path.
However, as you're about to pull the switch you notice that there's a single person tied down on the other track.
Here comes the dilemma: you can either choose to remove yourself from the situation and let five people get run over by a train, or you can pull the lever to save them while causing another person to die in the process.

This thought experiment along with its countless variations has become a prevalent force within ethics, psychology, and popular culture.
Although it's unlikely that any of us have or will ever go through a choice this difficult, people can have vastly different interpretations on what to do based on their own moral theories and values.
One person might argue that the choice to pull the level is an easy obligation to follow.
In one situation five people die, while in the other situation only one person dies.
They would say that we should choose the one with less suffering.
Another person would argue that the inherent wrongness of murder outweighs the well-being produced by the action.
If you pull the lever you'll have the blood of an innocent person on your hands, whereas if you don't pull it you're essentially removed from the situation.
Although the choice is a simple yes-or-no question, many people struggle to find the right choice.

To look at this choice further, I'll briefly introduce some of the main moral theories that are represented by each choice.
Although there are a countless amount of moral theories and disagreements within those theories, I'll be broadly referring to classical utilitarianism and deontological ethics.
An example of the person who pulls the lever would be the classical utilitarian.
Classical utilitarianism, which is generally attributed to 18th-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham, can be summed up as prioritizing the maximization of utility, or the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people.
While utilitarians disagree on what exactly this "good" is supposed to be, such as if some pleasures are greater than others, the classical form puts the pain and pleasure of all affected parties on spectrum and then chooses the actions that produces the greatest amount of pleasure and lowest amount of pain.
Because there would be less pain if only one person died, the lever should be pulled.
Deontology, which can be found in many forms through the works of Kant and Descartes, broadly says that actions have an intrinsic moral rightness or wrongness that should always be followed.
Kant puts this in the form of the categorical imperative, which states that we should never kill, lie, steal, or commit many other actions under any circumstances.
In the case of the trolley, a deontologist would likely argue that puling the lever is murder and is therefore immoral.

#### Trolley Problem Problems
Now that we have the background of the trolley problem, classical utilitarianism, and deontological ethics, we can start to get into what this post is really about.
I believe that the right answer is to pull the lever, but not in the classical utilitarian sense.
However, before that, I'll show why I believe pulling the lever is right to begin with.
If you believe that it is wrong to pull the lever, there are a few reasons why you might object.
First of all, if you follow the Kantian line of thought and believe that the murder is intrinsically wrong, you are forced to accept some pretty extreme conclusions.
The easiest one would be a simple extension of the classical trolley problem, but there are ten million people on the track instead of five.
You can either stand by and let ten million people get run over in succession, or you can take the simple step of pulling the lever and letting one person die.
If you wouldn't accept that, then try making the number of people even higher.
To make it even more extreme, you could try substituting the train with the worst torture possibly imaginable.
If in any one of these possible cases you believe it would be morally right to pull the lever, then you are forced to admit that murder is not objectively wrong.

Following this, we also run into the unique problem of the person who would refuse to pull the lever for five people, but would choose to pull the lever for ten million.
In order to remain morally consistent, they would have to come up with a justified reason why those two cases are different.
Some people consider themselves to be threshold deontologists, meaning that they are a deontologist until a certain threshold is met that will allow them to adopt consequentialist morality.
To anyone who follows this moral theory, I would challenge you in the following ways:

1. Choose a specific number at which the threshold is met
2. Justify that number with something concrete and specific
3. Provide evidence that the concrete factor should have moral relevance

In other words, you would have to find a situation where you would only pull the lever if exactly one person was added to the train tracks.
For example, you would have to justify an obligation to not pull the lever for forty-nine people along with an obligation to pull the lever for fifty people.

### Issues With Pleasure
By now, I hope to have convinced you, at least to some extent, to reject the purely deontological line of thought.
Although there are countless other theories that I could address, those will have to wait for another day.
Right now, we're left with the theory of utilitarianism.
Although there are many forms of utilitarianism I'll broadly lump most of them into the category of positive utilitarianism.
Positive utilitarians look at pain and pleasure as opposites on a spectrum.
For example a decision that results in one unit of pleasure and one unit of pain would be morally neutral.
Here, I'll make the argument that this line of thought is inadequate for our moral decisions.

To examine this, we'll look at the work of one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, Karl Popper.
Although it wasn't the focus of his work, he has made arguments against the supposed symmetry between suffering and happiness.
First, Popper rejects the idea that pain can just be treated as a negative version of pleasure, instead claiming that "pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure {% cite popper2002 %}."
For example, would you forcefully subject someone to the worst possible suffering possible, likely characterized by a combination of unending and limitless physical and mental torture, if it meant that a group of people could receive the greatest possible pleasure?
A positive utilitarian would be forced to say that this action would be morally correct, as it would create more happiness than suffering.
In a response to Popper, the Scottish writer Ninian Smart categorizes this view as a form of "negative utilitarianism" {% cite smart1958 %}.

The negative utilitarian view sees the best action as the one that reduces the most suffering, as opposed to the one that creates the most pleasure.
This view isn't necessarily one that is completely unintuitive as weird as it might originally sound.
In fact it even shares some roots with Buddhist thought.
Buddhist theologians suggest that Buddhism advocated for a minimization of "dukkha", which represents pain and dissatisfaction, as the ultimate moral goal.
In fact, the Noble Truths of Buddhism agrees with the negative utilitarian in the idea that "suffering cannot be compensated by happiness {% cite contestabile2014 %}."
However, there are some tough questions that we must answer if we are to accept the negative utilitarian perspective.
For example, is a painless murder wrong?
If someone will suffer even a small amount throughout the rest of their life, a negative utilitarian might be forced to accept that we should "put them out of their misery".
As an extension of that, we arrive at the somewhat infamous red button question, which asks if we should press a button that would instantly and painlessly exterminate all life in the universe.
This post is getting kind of long, but I'll eventually write a part-two that will explain some of the different types of negative utilitarianism along with my answers to those questions.
