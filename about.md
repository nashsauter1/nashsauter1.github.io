This blog is written entirely from a command line interface. For the articles, I use Neovim as an editor and Markdown to format the text.
I then use Jekyll to compile the site and Netlify to host the site from my Github repository.
If you see any citations or bibliographies, those were generated using the jekyll-scholar extension along with a BetterBibLatex bibliography file.
